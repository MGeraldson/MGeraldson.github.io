<h1>Week 3 - Vector and Rastar Images </h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p> Raster images, also known as bitmaps, are comprised of individual pixels of color. Each color pixel contributes to the overall image.

Raster images might be compared to pointillist paintings, which are composed with a series of individually-colored dots of paint. Each paint dot in a pointillist painting might represent a single pixel in a raster image. When viewed as an individual dot, it’s just a color; but when viewed as a whole, the colored dots make up a vivid and detailed painting. The pixels in a raster image work in the same manner, which provides for rich details and pixel-by-pixel editing.</p>
