<h1>Week 1 - SDLC</h1>

<h3>Software Development Life Cycle</h3>
<p>SDLC or the Software Development Life Cycle is a process that produces software with the highest quality and lowest cost in the shortest time possible. SDLC provides 
  a well-structured flow of phases that help an organization to quickly produce high-quality software which is well-tested and ready for production use.</p>
<p>SDLC works by lowering the cost of software development while simultaneously improving quality and shortening production time. SDLC achieves 
  these apparently divergent goals by following a plan that removes the typical pitfalls of software development projects. That plan starts by evaluating existing systems for deficiencies.</p>

 <p>Next, it defines the requirements of the new system. It then creates the software through the stages of analysis, planning, design, development, testing, and deployment. 
   By anticipating costly mistakes like failing to ask the end-user or client for feedback, SLDC can eliminate redundant rework and after-the-fact fixes.</p>

 <p>Itâ€™s also important to know that there is a strong focus on the testing phase. As the SDLC is a repetitive methodology, 
   you have to ensure code quality at every cycle. Many organizations tend to spend few efforts on testing while a stronger focus on testing can save them a lot of rework, time, and money. Be smart and write the right types of tests.
