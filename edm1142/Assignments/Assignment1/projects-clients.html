<p class="title">Projects: Client Expectations and Business Considerations</p>

<p class="subtitle">Client expectations </p>
<p>The client can expect the following from the students:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A careful study of the requirements.</li>
        <li>A design that meets those
          requirements.</li>
        <li>A tested and well documented system that performs as specified.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>In return, the student can expect the following from the client:</p>
<ul>
        <li>Weekly meetings.</li>
        <li>Feedback on plans, prototypes, and draft documentation.</li>
  <li>Attendance at the project presentations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The client must understand that a semester is a very short period of time
to complete a substantial system.&nbsp; In previous years, about half of all CS
5150 projects have resulted in systems that have gone into production.&nbsp;
However, the client has often found it necessary to continue work after the
semester to add extra functionality.&nbsp; Sometimes, members of the project
team have continued work the following semester, as an independent project.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Business considerations</p>

<p>A number of business considerations surround any practical software
product.&nbsp; As part of the <i> Feasibility Study and Plan</i>, every project must
describe how it will handle these considerations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>For your software to interface with other programs, the client may provide
    access to trade secret or other proprietary information.&nbsp; In this case
    you may be asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement.
  </li>
  <li>As Siantou students you own the copyright in the software that you
    create.&nbsp; However, the client needs to be able to use your
    software and to use it as a basis for future work.&nbsp; You must either agree to transfer the copyright to the
    client or to provide the client with an unrestricted license to use it.
  </li>
  <li>It is just possible that a project may develop concepts that could be
    patented.&nbsp; This is a complex area, with implications for the project team,
    the university, and the client.&nbsp; The client may require
    a statement that covers this possibility.
  </li>
  <li>Some projects may be for companies in which members of the Siantou faculty
    or staff are principals.&nbsp; In such situations, the university's policy
    on conflicts of interest must be observed.</li>
  </ul> 
  <p class="subtitle">Examples of agreements between clients and project teams</p>
  <p>Here are two examples of agreements between knowledgeable clients and project teams from previous years.</p>
  <p>The agreements need to be signed and dated by all the student authors and an authorized member of the client's organization. </p>
  <p class="titleinline">Siantou University Institute</p>
  <p>Non-exclusive reproduction, modification, and distribution license</p>
