      <p class="subtitle">Assignments</p>
	<p>The <a href="#reports">reports</a> and <a href="#presentations">presentations</a> are <strong>group assignments</strong> corresponding to major project milestones. The first assignment is a report. The other three assignments consist of both a presentation and a report or other documentation. </p>
	<p>With each assignment there is a survey to be completed <strong>individually</strong>. See the <a href="surveys.html">Surveys</a> page for more information. It is important that everybody completes each survey and submits it on time. The course team uses the surveys to monitor the progress of the projects and to understand the contributions made by each member of the team.</p>
	      <p class="subtitle">Assignment 1</p>
      <p>The deliverables for Assignment 1.0 are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> A written Feasibility Study and Plan (group assignment)</li>
        <li>Survey 1 (individual assignment)</li>
      </ul>  

<p class="titleinline">Feasibility Report</p>
<p>The exact form of the feasibility study is up to you. The length of the report is likely to be between five and ten pages. It should include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The client for whom the work will be done.  </li>
  <li>List of team members and email addresses.  </li>
  <li>A statement of the task to be undertaken. 
    
    A preliminary requirements analysis.</li>
  <li> Suggested deliverables.  </li>
  <li>Process to be followed, e.g., modified waterfall model, iterative refinement, incremental development, phased development, etc.  </li>
  <li>Outline plan, showing principal activities and milestones.  </li>
  <li>Visibility plan.  How will you keep in contact with the client and report progress?  How will you communicate among your team?  </li>
  <li>Discussion of business considerations (see the <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> pages on the Web site).  </li>
  <li>Risk analysis. What can go wrong? What is your fallback plan?  </li>
  <li>Probable technical requirements  </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some example of reports from earlier classes. They are very different in style, but each provides a good example of an effective report. They are placed here with the permission of the student teams.  </p>

  </ul>
 
<p class="subtitle">Assignment 1.1</p>
      <p>The purpose of Assignment 1.1 is to describe to your client and the course team the progress up to Milestone 2. The deliverables for Assignment 1.1 are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Presentation on Milestone 2 (group assignment)</li>
        <li>Report on Milestone 2 (group assignment)</li>
        <li>Survey 2 (individual assignment)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If the team is  following an <strong>iterative process</strong> Milestone 2 is likely to include a first set of requirements, a provisional design, and a 
	    prototype that can be used to demonstrate 
	    the functionality of the system. If the team is following a <strong>sequential</strong> development process, Milestone 2 should include completion of the requirements phase and preliminary design work.</p>
        	      <p class="subtitle">Assignment 1.2</p>
      <p>The purpose of Assignment 1.2 is to describe to your client and the course team the progress up to Milestone 3. The deliverables for Assignment 1.2 are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Presentation on Milestone 3 (group assignment)</li>
        <li>Report on Milestone 3 (group assignment)</li>
        <li>Survey 3 (individual assignment)</li>
      </ul>
<p>If the team is following an <strong>iterative process</strong> Assignment 1.2
	    should mark a major milestone when you can report visible progress to 
	    your client.&nbsp; If you are following a <strong>sequential process</strong>, this milestone will 
	    include the completion of the design phase and significant progress in the implementation.</p>
        	      <p class="subtitle">Assignment 4</p>
      <p>Assignment 1.3 consists of a presentation in which you will demonstrate your system in operation followed by the handover of the completed system and documentation to the client.  The deliverables for Assignment 4 are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Presentation and demonstration of the completed system(group assignment)</li>
        <li>Short report (group assignment)</li>
        <li>Delivery of system to the client (group assignment)</li>
        <li>Survey 4 (individual assignment)</li>
      </ul>
          <p><strong>Final Handover of the Project </strong></p>
          <p>During the semester you will be developing a set of materials that will be the handover package for your project. Because every project is different, the exact content of the package is 
            up to you, but it should be carefully edited and suitable for handover to your 
        client.&nbsp;&nbsp;The final package is likely to include some or all of the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A feasibility study </li>
            <li>Requirements analysis and specification</li>
            <li>System and program design</li>
            <li>User interface design and testing</li>
            <li>Test plan, test examples, and results</li>
            <li>Source and binary code </li>
            <li>Either transfer of the rights in the system to the client or an unrestricted license for the client (see the <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> pages on the Web site).&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
        
      <p class="subtitle"><a name="presentations"></a>Presentations</p>
      
          <p>During the semester each team will give three presentations with associated 
            reports on the work completed. You will make a 45 minute presentation 
            to the client, the Instructor and the Teaching Assistant assigned to your project.&nbsp; <strong>Everybody is expected to be a presenter at least 
              once.&nbsp;</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Available time slots for the presentation will be posted on the
            Home  page,</strong> with instructions on how  to schedule a time slot for your presentation. It is your responsibility
            to ensure that the client is available
            at  the time you schedule. The room will be provided with  a computer
            projector  and Internet connection.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>See <a href="materials.html#A">A3. Presentations</a> for advice on how to prepare for your presentations.  Before the first presentation, there will be a discussion in class of the goals of the presentations and how to prepare for them. </p>
          
	<p class="subtitle"><a name="reports"></a>Reports</p>
	All members of the project team should 
        share in the production of the reports. When you have completed a report, 
        (a) deliver it to the client, (b) send it by email to the Instructor and Teaching Assistant, (b) enter it into GForge or another software 
      project system, for future reference.
<p><strong>Reports for Milestones 2 and 3</strong> </p>
      <p>The report for each milestone should include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Review of progress since the previous milestone</li>
        <li>Revised schedule and plan for the remainder of the project</li>
        <li>Preliminary versions of the documentation for those parts of the project that have been worked up to the current milestone </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In writing each report, pay particular attention 
        to the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The report must be understandable by the client.</li>
        <li>The requirements must be the client's, not your own concepts, and must be specified in sufficient detail to test against 
          the implementation.</li>
        <li>Design concepts must be clearly separated from requirements.</li>
        <li>The design should include both system and program design.</li>
        <li>Requirements may be partitioned into those that must be met by 
          the first release and those that are optional.</li>
      </ul>
	  <p>Here are some examples of reports from earlier classes. They are very different in style, but each provides a good example of an effective report. They are placed here with the permission of the student teams.</p>
