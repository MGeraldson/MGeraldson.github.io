<p class="subtitle">The Projects</p>

<p>A major component of the course is a software development project. 
The objective is to develop a software product for an actual client who
intends to use it in regular production.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the course, you will form project teams with 6 to 8 members. During the semester, 
the project
team will work together through the full development cycle, from an initial feasibility study to delivering a functioning product, and
will make a series of presentations and reports of the work to the client.</p>
