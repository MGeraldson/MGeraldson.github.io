Question 1

The aim of this question is to identify students who make extra special contributions to the project and to ensure that everybody plays a significant part.
	
Since the completion of Assignment 3 your team has been working to complete the project, the final presentation, and the handover to your client.
	
Against each person's Registration No, estimate (to the nearest integer) what percentage of the total effort that person contributed. If, for example, you estimate that one member of your team did a quarter of the work for this task, then write 25 (no percent sign) in the pair of brackets against "percentage of work:". The total percentages should add up to 100.

1- Registration No: [ ], percentage of work: [ ]
2- Registration No: [ ], percentage of work: [ ]
3- Registration No: [ ], percentage of work: [ ]
4- Registration No: [ ], percentage of work: [ ]
5- Registration No: [ ], percentage of work: [ ]
6- Registration No: [ ], percentage of work: [ ]
7- Registration No: [ ], percentage of work: [ ]
8- Registration No: [ ], percentage of work: [ ]

Question 2

The purpose of this question is to provide visibility on the progress to the course team. Write your personal summary of how you feel about the project to date, not more than 100 words. What has gone well? What problems do you see?
