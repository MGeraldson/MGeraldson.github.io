Question 1

The aim of this question is to identify students who make extra special contributions to the project and to ensure that everybody plays a significant part.  Each part of the question refers to a task. For each task, estimate (to the nearest integer) what percentage of the total effort each member of the team (including yourself) contributed.

If, for example, you estimate that one member of your team did a quarter of the work for the first task, then write 25 (no percent sign) in the pair of brackets against "percentage of work:". If you have fewer than 8 people in your group, leave the extra lines blank. For each question, the total percentages should add up to 100.
