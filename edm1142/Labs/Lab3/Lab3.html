<h2>EDM1142 â€“ Lab 3</h2>

<h3>Due: November 6th</h3>
<p>
This lab deals with the analysis and design of a software problem .the tool used in a lab is 
rational rose .this tool is used for a object oriented design of a problem . We draw a uml 
diagram in a rational rose which deals with the objects and classes in a system .The Unified 
Modeling Language or UML is is a mostly graphical modelling language that is used to express 
designs. It is a standardized language in which to specify the artefacts and components of a 
software system. It is important to understand that the UML describes a notation and not a 
process. It does not put forth a single method or process of design, but rather is a standardized 
tool that can be used in a design process.</p>
<p>
The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standard language for specifying, visualizing, 
constructing, and documenting the artifacts of software systems, as well as for business modeling 
and other non-software systems. The UML represents a collection of best engineering practices 
that have proven successful in the modeling of large and complex systems.1</p>
<p>The UML is a very 
important part of developing object oriented software and the software development process.
The UML uses mostly graphical notations to express the design of software projects. Using the 
UML helps project teams communicate, explore potential designs, and validate the architectural 
design of the software.</p>
<p>Goals of UML
The primary goals in the design of the UML were:</p>
1. Provide users with a ready-to-use, expressive visual modeling language so they can 
develop and exchange meaningful models. <br>
2. Provide extensibility and specialization mechanisms to extend the core concepts. <br>
3. Be independent of particular programming languages and development processes. <br>
4. Provide a formal basis for understanding the modeling language. <br>
5. Encourage the growth of the OO tools market. <br>
6. Support higher-level development concepts such as collaborations, frameworks, patterns 
and components. <br>
7. Integrate best practices. <br>
<p>
Why Use UML?</p>
<p>
As the strategic value of software increases for many companies, the industry looks for 
techniques to automate the production of software and to improve quality and reduce cost and 
time-to-market. These techniques include component technology, visual programming, patterns 
and frameworks. Businesses also seek techniques to manage the complexity of systems as they 
increase in scope and scale. In particular, they recognize the need to solve recurring architectural 
problems, such as physical distribution, concurrency, replication, security, load balancing and 
fault tolerance. </p>

<p>
1. Write down the problem statement for a suggested system of relevance.</p>

<p>
  THEORY:</p>
<p>
The problem statement is the initial starting point for a project. It is basically a one to three page 
statement that everyone on the project agrees with that describes what will be done at a high 
level. The problem statement is intended for a broad audience and should be written in non-technical terms. It helps the non-technical and technical personnel communicate by providing a 
description of a problem. It doesn't describe the solution to the problem. 
The input to requirement engineering is the problem statement prepared by customer.
It may give an overview of the existing system along with broad expectations from the new 
system.</p>
<p>
The first phase of requirements engineering begins with requirements elicitation i.e. gathering of 
information about requirements. Here, requirements are identified with the help of customer and 
existing system processes. So from here begins the preparation of problem statement. 
So, basically a problem statement describes what needs to be done without describing how.
