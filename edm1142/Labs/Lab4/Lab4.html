1. Do requirement analysis and develop Software Requirement Specification Sheet
(SRS) for suggested system.</p>


<p>

Theory:</p>
<p>
An SRS is basically an organization's understanding (in writing) of a customer or potential 
client's system requirements and dependencies at a particular point in time (usually) prior to any 
actual design or development work. It's a two-way insurance policy that assures that both the 
client and the organization understand the other's requirements from that perspective at a given 
point in time. </p>
<p>
The SRS document itself states in precise and explicit language those functions and capabilities a 
software system (i.e., a software application, an eCommerce Web site, and so on) must provide, 
as well as states any required constraints by which the system must abide. The SRS also 
functions as a blueprint for completing a project with as little cost growth as possible. The SRS is 
often referred to as the "parent" document because all subsequent project management 
documents, such as design specifications, statements of work, software architecture 
specifications, testing and validation plans, and documentation plans, are related to it. 
It's important to note that an SRS contains functional and nonfunctional requirements only; it 
doesn't offer design suggestions, possible solutions to technology or business issues, or any other 
information other than what the development team understands the customer's system 
requirements to be.</p>

<p>
A well-designed, well-written SRS accomplishes four major goals: 
  <p>
 It provides feedback to the customer. An SRS is the customer's assurance that the 
development organization understands the issues or problems to be solved and the 
software behavior necessary to address those problems. Therefore, the SRS should be 
written in natural language (versus a formal language, explained later in this article), in 
an unambiguous manner that may also include charts, tables, data flow diagrams, 
decision tables, and so on. </p>
  <p>
 It decomposes the problem into component parts. The simple act of writing down 
software requirements in a well-designed format organizes information, places borders 
around the problem, solidifies ideas, and helps break down the problem into its 
component parts in an orderly fashion. </p>
<p>
 It serves as an input to the design specification. As mentioned previously, the SRS serves 
as the parent document to subsequent documents, such as the software design 
specification and statement of work. Therefore, the SRS must contain sufficient detail in 
the functional system requirements so that a design solution can be devised. </p>
<p>
 It serves as a product validation check. The SRS also serves as the parent document for 
testing and validation strategies that will be applied to the requirements for verification. 
SRSs are typically developed during the first stages of "Requirements Development," which 
is the initial product development phase in which information is gathered about what 
requirements are needed--and not. This information-gathering stage can include onsite visits, 
questionnaires, surveys, interviews, and perhaps a return-on-investment (ROI) analysis or 
needs analysis of the customer or client's current business environment. The actual 
specification, then, is written after the requirements have been gathered and analyzed. </p>

<p>
SRS should address the following
The basic issues that the SRS shall address are the following:</p>
<p>
a) Functionality. What is the software supposed to do? </p>
<p>
b) External interfaces. How does the software interact with people, the system‘s 
hardware, other hardware, and other software? </p>
<p>
c) Performance. What is the speed, availability, response time, recovery time of various 
software functions, etc.? </p>
<p>
d) Attributes. What are the portability, correctness, maintainability, security, etc. 
considerations? </p>
<p>
e) Design constraints imposed on an implementation. Are there any required standards 
in effect, implementation language, policies for database integrity, resource limits, 
operating environment(s) etc.?</p>
