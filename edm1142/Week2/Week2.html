<h1>Week 2 - SDLC-CI/CD</h1>

<h3>Software Development Life Cycle</h3>
<p>Continuous Integration refers to the process of merging all coding works of a software development project on a continuous basis. For instance, committing all code changes to a centralized repository can be considered as a simplified version of CI. The concept is further enhanced using automation tools, processes, and culture that drive rapid integration of iterative code developments. </p>
<p>CI strategies encourage small and frequent code commits that can be integrated faster, without breaking the resulting software functionality. The build servers run automated tests on the merged code to identify bugs early during the SDLC pipeline, validate and deliver new application changes to end users.<p>
 <p>Continuous Delivery extends CI to incorporate automated software release within the SDLC pipeline. The builds with continuously integrated code changes are automatically released to production after initial testing such as automated unit tests. At the production stage, the software build is available for in-depth testing and therefore ready for production, although a release may require further manual approval for business or technical reasons.<p>
