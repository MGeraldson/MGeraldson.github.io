<h1>Week 6 - B2C and B2B Marketing and Branding Strategies</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In this week we are going to look at B2C and B2B Marketing and Branding strategies. “B2B” stands for “business to business,” while “B2C” means “business to consumer.”
B2B businesses sell products and services directly to other businesses. Or, more specifically, 
they sell to the decision makers in any particular business. This can include everything from table management software for restaurants to marketing services to office chairs.
B2C businesses sell products and services to customers for personal use. This can include clothing, kitchenery and so much more.
