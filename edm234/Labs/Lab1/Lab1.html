<h1>Hal’s Woodworking</h1>
   <p>
Hal Donovan started an ordinary hardware store, named Hal’s Hardware in Sandusky, Ohio, in 
1988. He had been working during his summer vacations from college for a long-established 
hardware store and decided he liked the business. Hal’s Hardware developed an excellent 
reputation as a friendly neighborhood store. The store managers are all active in the community 
and the store regularly sponsors youth sports teams and supports local charities. When hired, 
salespeople go through a comprehensive training program that includes skill training in the areas 
of the store in which they will work (plumbing, electrical, power tools, flooring, garden, and so 
on), and they are trained in customer service skills. As a result of this focus on service, Hal’s 
Hardware became a community gathering place.</p>
   
   <p>
Hal offers classes and workshops for the homeowner and hobbyist three evenings each 
month and regularly schedules seminars for professional customers on weekday mornings. Many 
of these workshops and seminars are underwritten and taught by manufacturers to promote their 
products, but an increasing number are being created by Hal’s Hardware staff members.
In recent years, Hal has become concerned that the business is no longer growing. The 
store is facing increasing competition from hardware chains such as Home Depot and Lowe’s. 
These national chains have opened many new stores, and they are larger, carry more items, and 
offer lower prices on some items. The competition is fierce; for example, Hal’s Hardware closed 
its lumber department because of this competition. The national chains buy lumber in such large 
quantities that they can offer far lower prices. Hal matched his larger competitors’ prices, but 
found he was unable to earn a profit on lumber sales and that department consumed a large 
amount of floor space in the store.</p>
   <p>
Hal was worried that this sort of problem could develop in other departments, so he began 
looking for ways to add value to the customer experience, especially in ways that the national 
chains were not willing or able to do. For example, Hal has found that many people want to try 
out a new power tool in person before they spend hundreds of dollars on a purchase. Thus, Hal’s 
Hardware created a tool demonstration area staffed with salespeople who are experts in power
     tool operation. For each major type of power tool (drills, power saws, joiners, grinding tools, and 
so on), Hal created a small booklet of hints for using that type of tool. Hal’s salespeople give 
these booklets to customers as free handouts. They also sell Hal’s own low-cost instructional 
DVDs.</p>
   <p.
Hal’s Hardware currently has a Web site that includes general information about the 
company, directions to the store, and hours of operation. Hal is thinking about expanding the 
Web site to include online shopping. He is hoping that customers might find the Web site to 
be a useful way to order items, see whether items are in stock at the store, and comparison 
shop among different brands of a particular item. Hal also hopes that the Web site might reach 
customers who are not located near the store, but he realizes that some of his products do not 
have ideal shipping profiles.</p>
   
   <p.
Hal has been talking with Sarah Johnson, his most senior store manager, about his idea 
for adding online sales to the Web site. Sarah has been with the company for 20 years and has 
organized a number of the classes held on Saturday afternoons in the tool demonstration area. 
After hearing Hal’s ideas, she expressed some concerns. Sarah explained that going online with 
their entire product line might not make any sense because the competition for common tools is 
likely to be just as fierce online as it is in the store now. She has noticed that there seems to be 
a solid core of customers who are interested in serious woodworking and who show up for a lot 
of the classes. These customers buy some of the best, and most expensive, tools that the store 
sells. Many times, she finds that she has to specially order tools for these customers when they 
       are working on a specific project.</p>
   <p>
Sarah suggests to Hal that they might want to take the business in a different direction 
online and sell only the high-end specialty tools to dedicated woodworkers and cabinetmakers. 
These items yield much higher margins than the regular tools and the salespeople who Hal 
has hired are eager to develop videos and instruction sheets that would appeal to this more 
skilled and specialized audience. Sarah suggests that they call the new online business Hal’s 
Woodworking to distinguish it from the general hardware store business. She suggested that 
Hal take a look at Web sites such as Highland Woodworking and Woodworker’s Supply to get a 
better idea of the online store she has in mind.</p>

     <h2>REQUIRED:</h2></p>
<p>1. Conduct a SWOT analysis for the existing Hal’s Hardware store. You can use the information 
in the case narrative, your personal knowledge of the retail hardware and tool industry, and 
information you obtain by following the Web Links or doing independent searches of the 
Web as you conduct your analysis. Create a diagram similar to Figure 1-12 to summarize 
your SWOT analysis results.</p>
   <p>
2. Conduct a SWOT analysis for Sarah’s proposed Hal’s Woodworking online business. 
You can use the information in the case narrative, your personal knowledge of the retail 
hardware and tool industry, and information you obtain by following the Web Links or doing 
independent searches of the Web as you conduct your analysis. Create a diagram similar to 
Figure given during lectures to summarize your SWOT analysis results.</p>
   <p>
3. Based on your SWOT analysis of the proposed online business, write a report of about 400 
words that includes a summary of your assumptions and a list of specific recommendations 
for Hal’s Woodworking. These recommendations should specify the types of content that 
should appear on the Web site, the features that Hal should make available on the site, and 
how the site might overcome any of the weaknesses or threats you identified in the SWOT 
analysis.</p>
   <p>4. In about 100 words, outline any costs or benefits that the company might experience by 
operating both businesses at the same time.</p>
