<h1>Internet Access in Hyderabad</h1>

<p>
Hyderabad is the fourth-largest city in India, with a population of 9 million in the city itself and 
more than 15 million in the metropolitan area. It is the capital of the State of Andhra Pradesh, 
which has 86 million people and a $100 billion-per-year economy. Hyderabad itself accounts for 
about half of that annual activity, much of it in information technology (the city houses the Indian 
headquarters of Amazon.com, Google, and Microsoft, for example) and pharmaceuticals. With 
more than a dozen universities, the city is a leader in education and research.</p>
<p>
Like the rest of the country, however, citizens in the Hyderabad metropolitan area are less 
connected to the Internet than the city’s strong presence in the information technology industry 
would suggest. Overall, only about 1.7 million residents (about 19 percent of the population) have 
regular online access. About half of those with regular access use an Internet-capable phone 
as their primary access device. Approximately 85 percent of Hyderabad citizens own mobile 
phones, but most of them are not Internet-capable.</p>

<p>
Although the level of Internet access in Hyderabad is greater than the average for India, 
it lags far behind the United States, where more than 90 percent of the population has regular 
online access. It also lags behind online access in China, where about 46 percent of the 
population has regular online access (about 80 percent of that through mobile devices).</p>
<p>
REQUIRED:</p>
<p>
1. What are the implications of the low Internet access rates for the citizens of Hyderabad as 
they become active participants in the world economy over the next five years? Summarize 
your thoughts in about 100 words.</p>
<p>
2. Using your library or your favorite search engine, identify current trends in the growth of 
Internet-capable phones and other online access devices in India. In a report of about 200 
words, evaluate the prospects for significant changes in online access rates over the next 
few years.</p>
<p>
3. Use what you learned about online access technologies in this chapter to outline several 
alternatives that the government of Hyderabad should consider developing (perhaps in 
partnership with local information technology companies) that might increase online access 
rates for its citizens. Prepare a report of about 200 words in which you discuss at least two 
of these alternatives.</p>
