<h1>Progressive Insurance</h1>
<p>
In the 1980s, Progressive was a small auto insurance company that sold most of its policies to 
people who had poor driving records and could not qualify for the standard rate policies sold 
by other insurers. Progressive charged higher premiums for these policies, which the insurance 
industry calls substandard policies. Often, other insurers who could not write standard polices 
for customers would refer those customers to Progressive. The combination of high premiums 
and the lower cost of its smaller sales force enabled Progressive to earn good profits on this 
business. Eventually, other insurers noticed Progressive’s success and began to offer their own 
substandard policies.</p>

<p>
To respond to the increased competition, Progressive improved its claim service and 
became one of the first insurance companies to offer 24/7 service every day of the year. During 
the 1990s, Progressive gradually developed a full line of auto insurance products for all types 
of drivers and focused on offering the lowest prices in both standard and substandard markets. 
Although Progressive’s advertising mentions the quality of its service, it always emphasizes its 
low prices.</p>

<p>
Progressive was the first auto insurance company to launch a Web site (in 1995) and was 
the first to sell policies online (in 1997). Knowing that most potential insurance buyers shop 
multiple Web sites to find the best rate, the company began showing its competitors’ rates on its 
Web site in 2002, allowing potential customers to compare prices without leaving Progressive’s 
site. The site displays these rates even when Progressive’s rate is higher than a competitor’s rate 
on a particular policy.</p>

<p>
Progressive’s management has expressed a belief that people prefer to buy insurance 
from honest companies who offer the best prices. In 2008, Progressive introduced a female 
character, “Flo,” who embodies openness, honesty, and a devotion to low prices. Flo appears in 
the company’s television and radio ads, and is featured prominently on its Web site. In fact, the 
character often appears in television ad vignettes that tout the price comparison feature of the 
Web site.</p>
<p>
REQUIRED:</p>

<p>
1. Many managers would be reluctant even to mention competitors, much less provide their 
competitor’s prices to potential customers. In about 200 words, outline Progressive’s reasons 
for showing competitors’ prices and analyze the costs and benefits of doing so.</p>
<p>
2. In the chapter, you learned that it is important for a company to present an image consistent 
with its philosophy, principles, and identity on its Web site. In about 100 words, explain how 
Progressive does or does not accomplish this objective.</p>
<p>
3. Visit the Progressive Web site and assume you are a potential customer who needs 
insurance for a used car you plan to buy. Evaluate the usability of the site and write a report 
of about 100 words in which you describe your experience. Be sure to mention specific site 
features that were or were not helpful and conclude with an overall impression of the site’s 
effectiveness.</p>
