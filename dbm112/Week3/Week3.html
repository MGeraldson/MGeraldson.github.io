<h1>Week 3 - Introduction to Statistics </h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p> In Maths, Statistics is a method of interpreting, analysing and summarising the data. Hence, the types of statistics are categorised based on these features: Descriptive and inferential statistics. Based on the representation of data such as using pie charts, bar graphs, or tables, we analyse and interpret it.

Statistics is the application of Mathematics, which was basically considered as the science of the different types of stats. For example, the collection and interpretation of data about a nation like its economy and population, military, literacy, etc.

In terms of mathematical analysis, the statistics include linear algebra, stochastic study, differential equation and measure-theoretic probability theory.</p>
