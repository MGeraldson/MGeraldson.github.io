<h1>Week 2 - DML </h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>A data manipulation language (DML) is a computer programming language used for adding (inserting), deleting, and modifying (updating) data in a database.
  A DML is often a sublanguage of a broader database language such as SQL, with the DML comprising some of the operators in the language. 
  Read-only selecting of data is sometimes distinguished as being part of a separate data query language (DQL), but it is closely related and 
  sometimes also considered a component of a DML; some operators may perform both selecting (reading) and writing.</p>
